# github-intro-to-releases
A repo to help demonstrate the use of releases and creating/updating from workflows

The trigger for all of this could vary, but this repo is set up to have someone create a release (UI, API call, etc.) which will ick off a workflow that builds an applicaition (fictional in this repo), add comments/description to the release, and generate release notes.

Additionally, but not being done currently, is moving the release from **Pre-release** to **Latest** upon successful completion of the workflow.
