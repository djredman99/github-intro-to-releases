# Intro to Releases as a Workflow Trigger
A repo to help demonstrate the use of releases and creating/updating from workflows

The trigger for all of this could vary, but this repo is set up to have someone create a release (UI, API call, etc.) which will ick off a workflow that builds an applicaition (fictional in this repo), add comments/description to the release, and generate release notes.

Additionally, but not being done currently, is moving the release from **Pre-release** to **Latest** upon successful completion of the workflow.

*TODO*
- Use a release.yml to show how to customize the release notes

I am adding more content to demonstrate release notes creation on release creation. I added this code change as a direct commit to main and no release note info was available.

I will add content through PRs to show Release Note content.
